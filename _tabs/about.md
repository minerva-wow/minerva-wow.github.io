## About Me

I'm Andrea, an engineer and content creator passionate about building things that matter. My expertise spans:

* **Embedded Systems**: STM32 microcontrollers and real-time applications
* **Blockchain & Fintech**: Cryptocurrency protocols and digital payment solutions  
* **Full-Stack Development**: React/Next.js frontends, Node.js/Go backends, and React Native mobile apps

Inspired by innovators like Fabrice Bellard, I believe in pushing the boundaries of what's possible through code.
