When writing a blog, I needed an easy way to insert timestamps in a specific format. Instead of using the command line with Jekyll-Compose to create new posts, I recommend the **Insert Date String** extension for VS Code. It’s simple to install from the VS Code marketplace. Below is a guide to configuring the date format.

In the settings (shortcut **Ctrl + ,**), search for **Insert Date String**. For a standard format, use `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss ZZZZ` (where the last part represents the time zone). You can explore other format options on the extension's homepage.

Now, you're all set to write your blog more efficiently! ☆*: .｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:*☆

By the way, the shortcut to quickly insert the date is **Ctrl + Shift + I**.
