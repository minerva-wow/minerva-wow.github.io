## Science Videos
1. [Capacitors are terrible at remembering data. But for this reason we continue doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WnbIeMgWYA) - In this episode we discuss about Dynamic RAM, and learn about all the fundamental-level challenges that makes it slow compared to Static RAM.

2. [HOW TRANSISTORS REMEMBER DATA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM9BjciBLmg) - In this episode we learn about how memory works at the "transistor" level.

3. [How I hacked a hardware crypto wallet and recovered $2 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT9y-KQbqi4) - I was contacted to hack a Trezor One hardware wallet and recover $2 million worth of cryptocurrency (in the form of THETA). Knowing that existing research was already out there for this device, it seemed like it would be a slam dunk. Little did I realize the project would turn into a roller coaster ride with over three months of experimentation, failures, successes, and heart-stopping moments. It reminded me that hacking is always unpredictable, exciting, and educational, no matter how long you've been doing it. In this case, the stakes were higher than normal: I only had one chance to get it right. 

4. [How do CRCs work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izG7qT0EpBw) - CRC (cyclic redundancy check) is one of the most common methods of error detection. It uses some interesting mathematical tricks to guarantee that it can catch certain kinds of errors. How does it work?

5. [How USB Flash Drive Works?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy7_XC8hZ5c) - Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a casual user, this video will provide you with a deeper understanding of How USB Flash Drives Work and how to use them effectively. In this video, we'll explore the inner workings of USB flash drives and how they store and transfer data. We'll take a closer look at the various components of a USB flash drive, such as the NAND flash memory chips and the controller chip that manages data transfer.<br>
We'll also discuss the basic working principle of USB flash drives, including how they use electrical impulses to write and read data from the NAND flash memory chips.

## Technical Articles
1. [Quadratic Funding 平方募資](https://medium.com/swf-lab/quadratic-funding-465b5da3b3c9) - A deep dive into the Liberal Radical Mechanism proposed by Ethereum's co-founder, a Harvard economist, and Microsoft's principal researcher

2. [Decentralize Social Media](https://medium.com/@rossulbricht/decentralize-social-media-cc47dcfd4f99) - Centralization of social media networks has led to a host of problems for social media platforms and their users. These include privacy breaches and the impossible task of moderating the content of billions of users.<br>
Below I describe a decentralized social protocol (DSP) that can help solve or mitigate these problems by giving users control over their own content and putting them in charge of value creation and transfer within their networks. This is made possible by allowing users to choose from a multitude of interface providers, content servers and advertisers, rather than a single platform that monopolizes these essential roles. I describe decentralized solutions to profile management, privacy, hosting, user interfaces, ad networks, content filters, metadata and more. In short, all the essential components of social media.
