This article caters to two distinct audiences: those with an economics background and those without. For readers versed in economics, particularly those who've taken microeconomics, the content should be readily accessible. For others, I recommend skipping the sections marked with asterisks (*) which contain mathematical derivations requiring microeconomics fundamentals. I'll strive to keep the explanations as intuitive as possible.

# Introduction
Quadratic funding emerged from a paper titled "Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design for Philanthropic Matching Funds," co-authored by Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum co-founder) and two economists. The concept draws inspiration from "quadratic voting," an idea presented in Glen Weyl's book "Radical Markets."
Quadratic voting challenges the conventional "one person, one vote" (1p1v) principle where each vote carries equal weight. While this might sound controversial at first, consider this scenario:
Imagine an election where:

Alice would gain $20 if candidate X wins
Bob would gain $10
Charlie would lose $50

Under the traditional one-person-one-vote system, Charlie has no recourse to express the magnitude of their potential loss. The system doesn't allow individuals to weight their votes according to how much they stand to gain or lose â€“ even if they're willing to pay more for greater influence.
This raises a fundamental question: Should individuals have the option to pay more for greater voting power? While this notion might seem radical, it addresses a real limitation in current democratic systems.
