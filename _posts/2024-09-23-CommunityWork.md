As a senior, I often reflect on my college journey and the regrets I have—like not joining the Electrical Engineering Club earlier and hesitating about Information Security. This motivated me to join the Innovation Alliance, where I was fortunate to secure a spot in the planning team thanks to the juniors.

Our group, consisting of two junior girls and two boys, was exceptional. We engaged in productive discussions and I gained valuable insights. However, as deadlines approached, the pressures of applications and internships began to weigh heavily on me, leading me to ultimately step back from the project. I’m grateful for my understanding teammates.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Effective Planning Workflow:**
   - **Day 1:** Analyze and brainstorm the theme. Use AI tools for initial drafts if necessary.
   - **Days 2-4:** Refine your sections and provide feedback to each other. Early discussions lead to better outcomes.
   - **Day 5:** Review contributions based on meeting notes and integrate feedback.
   - **Day 6:** Conduct a final check for clarity and logic.
   - **Day 7:** Finalize the document in Word for presentation.

2. **Prioritize Teamwork:**
   - Fostering collaboration can transform raw ideas into well-developed plans, benefitting everyone involved. Our discussions turned initial concepts into actionable strategies.

3. **Constructive Feedback:**
   - Address issues directly, but tactfully. The aim is to promote improvement, not to blame. Providing actionable suggestions enhances growth and strengthens team dynamics.

### Final Thoughts

This experience has taught me the value of adaptability and communication in team settings. I look forward to applying these lessons in future projects.
